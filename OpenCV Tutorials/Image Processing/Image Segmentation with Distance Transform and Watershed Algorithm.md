Goal

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Use the OpenCV function cv::filter2D in order to perform some laplacian filtering for image sharpening
* Use the OpenCV function cv::distanceTransform in order to obtain the derived representation of a binary image, where the value of each pixel is replaced by its distance to the nearest background pixel
* Use the OpenCV function cv::watershed in order to isolate objects in the image from the background
