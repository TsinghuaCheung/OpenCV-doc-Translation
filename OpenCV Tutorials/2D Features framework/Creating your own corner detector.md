Goal

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Use the OpenCV function cv::cornerEigenValsAndVecs to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to determine if a pixel is a corner.
* Use the OpenCV function cv::cornerMinEigenVal to find the minimum eigenvalues for corner detection.
* Implement our own version of the Harris detector as well as the Shi-Tomasi detector, by using the two functions above.
